# M?

Super simple variable watcher for rails apps. Just type:

```ruby
M? interesting_variable_to_watch
```

anywhere in your app and you will get entry with timestamp and location of caller in your freshly made `log/m.log` file.
Why `M?`? Because it types fast and shouldn't have any name collision;)
